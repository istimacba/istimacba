I find it fascinating, making at least 2 people communicate over long distances via machines, in seconds only.
Back in time, it would take weeks and months for a messenger riding on a horse.

And what if you wanted to copy a handwritten book and distribute?
Penmans spending days and weeks, for a dozen of copies, now it takes only a few seconds, to have nearly infinite.

And a group of people, up to something great, needed all the papers flying around to keep their records and adjust.
Sending runners all over the place, to inform and coordinate.
Now it takes only a few clicks and a few keystrokes.
